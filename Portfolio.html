            "We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions
             are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which
              we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society."
    
            "This is the real secret of life â€” to be completely engaged with what you are
             doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play."

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h3>
    <pre style="text-align: left;"> 
            The best word to describe me would undoubtedly be 'creative'. Everything that
        I do or learn is just one step closer towards using those skills to create
        something new, whether that be a new painting, book, sculpture, game, song, etc.
        Creativity is at the heart of all of my curiosities and passions, and always
        has been!
            I am very passionate about music in particular, nd can rant about the history
        importance of certain music genre's for HOURS at a time, if someone let me! Chances
        are you'll definitely learn something new when talking to me about music, like
        the political significance of japanese noise music, or the rise of the many alt
        subcultures in retaliation to oppression. Test me sometime!

    <pre style="text-align: left;"> 
            This is a placeholder image, as all the images of my projects haven't  been
        imported yet. this is where i would normally preview a project I'm working on. 
        For example: The image to the left is a still from the videogame script i'm 
        currently working on. I came up with the basics for this earlier in the year,
        and since then I've been slowly but surely working out the script for the game,
        details like where the character wil go, what he'll find, who he'll meet, and
        objectives.
            The process has been slow since i've been trying to do other projects and 
        up with my schoolwork and mental health more. Still, I'm proud of the progress
        I've made here.
