        <h5 style="text-align: center;">"We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions
            are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which
             we did not  invent, but which were given to us by our society."</h5>

             <p>For now, this quote is just a random quote from Alan Watts, whose my fave writer and philosopher btw. I listen to a lot of his talks!</p>
             <p>My name is Kadijatu Tal, I'm 17, A student at Fern Creek High School, and just trying my best. I'm From Senegal, Came here when
                 I was 4, and have been here in Louisville ever since. I'm a creative soul at heart, and soak up knowledge like a sponge.
                 Seriously, i have a wide reportoire of random, semi-useless knowledge that I'm quite proud of. For now this is mostly filler, 
                 we can come back and edit all of this later!
             </p>
             <p>"Begin today!" That's all the note said. There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away.
                 The wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. It had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate. The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the mother Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack.
                 The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.</p>
